# Support

We support a large Discord community. Choose the path that fits your case:

## 1) Quick help (recommended)
- Use the search (**Cmd/Ctrl + K**).
- Check the **FAQ**.
- Ask in **#support** on Discord. Provide context: UE version, plugin version, steps, screenshots/logs.

## 2) Ticket support (optional)
If your issue is reproducible or requires private data, open a **ticket** in the Discord server.

**Before opening a ticket, please prepare:**  
- Your **@EPIC GAMES** Linked Role (see <a href="/linked-roles">Linked Roles</a>)  
- **Order ID / Purchase ID** — find it in your <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/account/transactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic account Transactions</a> or email receipt  
- Plugin name, your UE version, and a clear description (steps to reproduce, errors, screenshots/logs)

**Response times & auto‑close**  
We work across time zones. Tickets may auto‑close after inactivity—reply in the ticket to keep it open or reopen later if needed.

> Please avoid sharing sensitive personal info or license keys in public channels.

## Escalation
Blockers in the editor or regressions are prioritized. For security issues, contact a moderator directly on Discord.
