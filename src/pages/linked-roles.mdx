# Linked Roles — verify your Epic Games account

We use **Discord's Linked Roles** so members can prove they own an **Epic Games** account before unlocking channels and support features.

## Step 1 — Link Epic Games ↔ Discord (one‑time)

1. Open the official Epic guide and follow the steps: <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/account-c-202300000001645/connected-accounts-c-202300000001754/how-do-i-link-my-discord-account-to-my-epic-games-account-a202300000012834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How do I link my Discord account to my Epic Games account?</a>
2. Sign in to your **Epic Games** account when prompted.
3. Authorize **Discord** to connect to Epic Games.
4. After linking, confirm you can see **Epic Games** under **Discord → User Settings → Connections**.

> You can unlink or re‑authorize later from Epic account settings if needed.

## Step 2 — Claim the **@EPIC GAMES** role in our server

1. In Discord, click the **server name** at the top‑left to open the **server menu**.
2. Select **Linked Roles**.
3. Choose **@EPIC GAMES** and start verification. Discord checks your Epic connection and assigns the role if everything looks good.
4. If verification fails, re‑open the flow to ensure the connection is active, then try again.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- If you don’t see **Linked Roles**, make sure you opened the **server menu** (top‑left, next to the channel list) and that the feature is enabled for the server.
- If the role won’t apply, check **Discord → Settings → Connections** and ensure your **Epic Games** connection is present.
- Need help? Ask in **#support** on Discord and describe what you already tried (no personal data).
