## 🌊 FFT Wave Improvements

The latest update brings significant improvements to our Fast Fourier Transform wave simulation:

- **Higher Resolution** — Support for up to 512x512 FFT grids
- **Better Performance** — Optimized compute shaders for 20% faster rendering
- **Improved Blending** — Smoother transitions between wave cascades

## 🏖️ Enhanced Coastline System

Our coastline rendering has been completely revamped:

- Real-time shoreline foam generation
- Depth-based wave breaking
- Wet sand effects with proper PBR materials
- Configurable beach profiles

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

We've focused heavily on making NextGen run better on a wider range of hardware:

- **C++ QuadTree LOD** — Native code for faster tessellation decisions
- **Async GPU Readback** — Non-blocking buoyancy calculations
- **Instanced Rendering** — Better batching for foam particles

## 🎮 New Features

- **Multiplayer Support** — Synchronized waves across clients
- **Blueprint API** — Easy integration with game logic
- **Preset System** — One-click ocean configurations

:::info Coming Soon
We're working on real-time underwater caustics and volumetric fog for Q1 2026.
