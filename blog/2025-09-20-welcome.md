# Welcome

Galidar Studio builds water systems for Unreal Engine: **Oceanology Legacy**, **Oceanology NextGen**, and **Riverology**. This blog is where we share what's shipping, how to use it, and what's next.

## What you'll find
- **Release notes** and deep-dives on oceans, rivers, and underwater rendering.
- **Guides & tutorials** for setup, buoyancy, swimming, and performance tuning.
- **Roadmap updates** and calls for feedback from the community.

:::tip New to our plugins?
Start with **Oceanology NextGen** for the broadest feature set. Choose **Legacy** for maximum performance on mid-range GPUs. Use **Riverology** for spline-based rivers with flow and bank effects.
