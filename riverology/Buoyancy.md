# Riverology — Buoyancy

_Last updated: 2025-12-08_

## Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.6 or newer.
- **Oceanology Legacy** installed and configured (see the **Setup** page).
- A **BP_Riverology** actor placed in your level with waves configured (see the **River Waves** page).
- Basic familiarity with **physics simulation**, **collision**, and **Static Mesh Actors** in Unreal Engine.

## Notes
- Riverology includes a built-in buoyancy system that allows objects to float on the river surface without requiring additional components. Unlike ocean buoyancy which uses the **OceanBuoyancyComponent**, river buoyancy is handled directly by the **BP_Riverology** actor.
- Any physics-simulating actor that overlaps with the river volume will automatically receive buoyancy forces when **Enable Buoyancy** is active on the river.
- The buoyancy calculation respects wave height, meaning floating objects will rise and fall with the river's Gerstner wave simulation.
- River buoyancy also applies **flow forces**, pushing objects downstream along the spline direction. This creates realistic current behavior for floating debris, boats, or characters.

## Step-by-step

:::note 1. Add the Riverology actor to your level
Open your level and use the **Quickly Add to the Project** menu (the `+` button in the toolbar or right-click in the viewport). Type `BP_Riverology` in the search field.

Select **BP_Riverology** from the results and drag it into your scene. This Blueprint contains the river spline, water rendering, wave simulation, and buoyancy system.

If you already have a river placed, you can skip this step and select the existing BP_Riverology actor.

:::

:::note 2. Enable buoyancy on the river
Select the **BP_Riverology** actor in your level. In the **Details** panel, configure the following settings:

**Transform:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Location** | `X, Y, Z` | Position of the river spline origin |
| **Rotation** | `0.0°, 0.0°, 0.0°` | Orientation of the river |
| **Scale** | `1.0, 1.0, 1.0` | Uniform scale (typically unchanged) |
| **Mobility** | `Movable` | Required for runtime physics interaction |

**Buoyancy:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Enable Buoyancy** | ✅ Enabled | Master toggle for river buoyancy system |

**Important:** The **Mobility** must be set to **Movable** for buoyancy to function. Static or Stationary rivers cannot apply physics forces to overlapping actors.

When **Enable Buoyancy** is checked, any physics-simulating actor that enters the river volume will automatically receive upward buoyancy forces and downstream flow forces.

## Configuring Buoyant Objects

For an object to float in the river, it must be properly configured for physics simulation. This section demonstrates the required settings using a simple cube.

:::note 3. Configure the Static Mesh for physics simulation
Create or select a **Static Mesh Actor** that you want to float in the river. In the **Details** panel, configure the following:

**Static Mesh:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Static Mesh** | `Cube` (or any mesh) | The visual geometry of the floating object |

**Physics:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Simulate Physics** | ✅ Enabled | **Critical** — Enables physics simulation |
| **Mass (kg)** | `177.827942` | Calculated from mesh volume and density. Affects how deep the object floats. |
| **Linear Damping** | `0.01` | Resistance to linear movement. Low values allow free floating. |
| **Angular Damping** | `0.0` | Resistance to rotation. Zero allows natural tumbling in current. |
| **Enable Gravity** | ✅ Enabled | Gravity pulls down, buoyancy pushes up |

**Constraints:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Lock Position** | `X ❌ Y ❌ Z ❌` | All unlocked for free movement |
| **Lock Rotation** | `X ❌ Y ❌ Z ❌` | All unlocked for natural rotation |
| **Mode** | `Default` | Standard constraint behavior |

**Advanced Physics Options:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Gravity Group Index** | `0` | Default gravity group |
| **Update Kinematic from Simulation** | ❌ Disabled | Not needed for standard buoyancy |
| **Gyroscopic Torque Enabled** | ❌ Disabled | Simplifies rotation behavior |
| **Ignore Radial Impulse** | ❌ Disabled | Allows explosion forces |
| **Ignore Radial Force** | ❌ Disabled | Allows radial force fields |
| **Apply Impulse on Damage** | ✅ Enabled | Reacts to damage events |
| **Replicate Physics to Autonomous Proxy** | ✅ Enabled | Network replication support |

The **Mass** value is particularly important for buoyancy behavior. Heavier objects sit lower in the water and are more resistant to wave motion, while lighter objects bob more dramatically.

:::

:::note 4. Configure collision settings
Still on the Static Mesh Actor, locate the **Collision** category. Proper collision setup is essential for buoyancy detection.

**Collision:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Simulation Generates Hit Events** | ❌ Disabled | Optional — enable for impact sounds/effects |
| **Phys Material Override** | `None` | Uses default physical material |
| **Generate Overlap Events** | ✅ Enabled | **Required** — Detects river volume overlap |
| **Can Character Step Up On** | `Yes` | Allows characters to stand on floating object |

**Collision Presets:**

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Collision Presets** | `PhysicsActor` | Pre-configured for physics objects |
| **Collision Enabled** | `Collision Enabled (Query and Physics)` | Full collision support |
| **Object Type** | `PhysicsBody` | Identifies as a physics-simulated object |

**Collision Responses:**

| Channel | Ignore | Overlap | Block |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Visibility** | | | ✅ |
| **Camera** | | | ✅ |
| **WorldStatic** | | | ✅ |
| **WorldDynamic** | | | ✅ |
| **Pawn** | | | ✅ |
| **PhysicsBody** | | | ✅ |
| **Vehicle** | | | ✅ |
| **Destructible** | | | ✅ |

The **PhysicsActor** preset provides sensible defaults for most floating objects. All channels are set to **Block**, ensuring the object collides properly with the environment and other physics objects.

**Streaming Settings:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Generate Overlap Events During Level Streaming** | ❌ Disabled |
| **Update Overlaps Method During Level Streaming** | `Use Config Default` |
| **Default Update Overlaps Method During Level Streaming** | `Only Update Movable` |

:::

:::note 5. Configure actor settings
In the **Actor** category, configure general actor properties that affect spawning and gameplay:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Actor Guid** | Auto-generated | Unique identifier for this actor instance |
| **1 selected in** | `Persistent Level` | Level where this actor resides |
| **Convert Actor** | `Select a Type` | Option to convert to different actor type |
| **Can be Damaged** | ✅ Enabled | Allows damage events to affect this actor |
| **Initial Life Span** | `0.0` | Infinite lifespan (0 = never destroyed) |
| **Spawn Collision Handling Method** | `Always Spawn, Ignore Collisions` | Ensures spawning even if overlapping |

The **Spawn Collision Handling Method** is important for runtime-spawned floating objects. Setting it to `Always Spawn, Ignore Collisions` ensures objects appear even if they initially overlap with terrain or other actors.

## Buoyancy Behavior Summary

When properly configured, floating objects in Riverology exhibit these behaviors:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Vertical Buoyancy** | Objects are pushed upward to float at the water surface |
| **Wave Response** | Objects rise and fall with Gerstner wave motion |
| **Flow Force** | Objects are pushed downstream along the spline direction |
| **Mass-Dependent Depth** | Heavier objects float lower in the water |
| **Damping Effects** | Linear/Angular damping affects how quickly objects settle |

## Object Configuration Reference

### Physics Settings by Object Type

| Object Type | Mass (kg) | Linear Damping | Angular Damping | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Small Debris** | `1` – `10` | `0.5` | `0.5` | Bobs freely, moves quickly with current |
| **Wooden Crate** | `50` – `150` | `0.1` | `0.1` | Stable floating, moderate wave response |
| **Barrel** | `100` – `300` | `0.2` | `0.3` | Rolls naturally in current |
| **Log** | `200` – `500` | `0.05` | `0.1` | Slow, stable, aligned with flow |
| **Small Boat** | `500` – `2000` | `1.0` | `1.0` | Stable platform, dampened motion |
| **Large Vessel** | `5000+` | `1.5` | `1.5` | Minimal wave response, strong stability |

### Damping Guidelines

| Damping Value | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| `0.0` | No resistance — object moves/rotates freely |
| `0.01` – `0.1` | Minimal resistance — natural floating behavior |
| `0.5` – `1.0` | Moderate resistance — stabilized motion |
| `2.0` – `5.0` | High resistance — sluggish, dampened response |
| `10.0+` | Extreme resistance — nearly stationary in water |

## River vs Ocean Buoyancy Comparison

| Aspect | Ocean Buoyancy | River Buoyancy |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Component Required** | `OceanBuoyancyComponent` | None (built into BP_Riverology) |
| **Pontoon System** | Yes (configurable points) | No (automatic volume detection) |
| **Flow Forces** | Optional (via settings) | Automatic (follows spline) |
| **Wave Sampling** | Per-pontoon | Per-object center |
| **Setup Complexity** | Higher (component + pontoons) | Lower (just enable physics) |
| **Fine-Tuning** | Extensive parameters | Limited to physics settings |

**When to use which:**
- **Ocean Buoyancy** — Complex vessels requiring precise floating behavior, multiple pontoon sampling, custom buoyancy forces.
- **River Buoyancy** — Simple floating objects, debris, quick prototyping, objects that need to flow with current.

## Integration with Other Systems

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| **River Waves** | Wave amplitude affects vertical displacement of floating objects |
| **Landscape** | River depth from terrain deformation determines buoyancy volume |
| **Flow Direction** | Objects are pushed along the spline tangent direction |
| **Niagara Effects** | Splash particles can be triggered by floating object collisions |
| **Swimming** | Characters use different buoyancy system (see Swimming page) |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Object doesn't float | Simulate Physics disabled | Enable Simulate Physics on the object |
| Object sinks immediately | Mass too high | Reduce Mass value or increase object volume |
| Object flies out of water | Mass too low | Increase Mass value |
| Object doesn't move with current | River Mobility not Movable | Set BP_Riverology Mobility to Movable |
| Buoyancy not working at all | Enable Buoyancy unchecked | Enable the checkbox on BP_Riverology |
| Object passes through riverbed | Collision misconfigured | Set Collision Preset to PhysicsActor |
| Erratic floating behavior | Damping too low | Increase Linear and Angular Damping |
| Object rotates uncontrollably | Angular Damping at zero | Increase Angular Damping to 0.5+ |
| No flow movement | Object outside river volume | Ensure object overlaps with river spline area |
