Choosing the right water simulation plugin can make or break your project. Let's find the perfect match for your needs.

<!-- truncate -->

## 🤔 The Big Question

We often get asked: *"Which plugin should I buy?"*

The answer depends on three factors:
1. **Target hardware** — What GPUs will your players have?
2. **Water type** — Ocean, river, or both?
3. **Visual requirements** — AAA quality or optimized performance?
