## Key Features

### 🌊 21-Spline Animation System

Create complete wave lifecycles using our proprietary 21-spline system:

| Phase | Splines | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Swell** | 1-4 | Deep water wave approaching shore |
| **Rise** | 5-7 | Wave steepening as depth decreases |
| **Barrel** | 8-16 | Tube formation and curl development |
| **Collapse** | 17-19 | Breaking and energy dissipation |
| **Wash** | 20-21 | Foam rush and shore interaction |

### ⚡ WebGPU-Powered Rendering

Experience real-time 3D visualization with cutting-edge WebGPU technology:

- **16-bit Float HDR** rendering precision
- **Real-time preview** of wave animations
- **Multiple projection modes** for different use cases
- **Light table system** for comparing spline variations

### 🎛️ Professional Editing Tools

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Spline Editor** | Hermite curve manipulation with tangent controls |
| **Phase Offset** | Cycle shift for animation timing |
| **Auto Dissipation** | Physics-based energy falloff preview |
| **Light Table** | Overlay multiple frames for comparison |
| **Frame Selection** | Navigate through wave progression |

### 📤 Multiple Export Formats

Export your custom wave profiles in formats compatible with various workflows:

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **16-bit HDR Textures** | Direct import to Unreal Engine materials |
| **HLSL Code** | Custom shader integration |
| **LUA Scripts** | Runtime wave generation |
