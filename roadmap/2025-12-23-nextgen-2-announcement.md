# Oceanology Pro 2.0 - A Complete Revolution

After months of intensive development, we're thrilled to announce **Oceanology Pro 2.0** (formerly NextGen) - the most significant update in the history of our water simulation plugin. This isn't just an update; it's a complete reimagining of what's possible with real-time ocean rendering in Unreal Engine 5.

:::note Product Naming
Oceanology NextGen is being renamed to **Oceanology Pro** with the 2.0 release. No re-purchase needed — all existing NextGen customers receive this update for free. [Read the full announcement →](/roadmap/product-rebranding-announcement)

## 🎯 What Makes 2.0 Special?

Oceanology Pro 2.0 introduces **three major new systems** that work together to create the most realistic water simulation ever seen in a game engine:

### 1. Spectral Gerstner Waves

A completely new wave simulation system based on **oceanographic research** and the **Beaufort Scale**. Instead of manually tweaking individual wave parameters, you now control the ocean with intuitive real-world concepts:

- **Beaufort Scale (0-12)**: From glassy calm to hurricane conditions
- **Wind Direction**: Waves naturally align and spread around wind vectors
- **Energy Distribution**: Realistic frequency spectrum from swells to capillaries
- **Up to 128 wave components** synthesized in real-time

The result? Oceans that look and behave like real oceans, with proper dispersion relations and physically accurate foam generation.

### 2. Breaking Waves (Coastal Waves)

The feature our community has requested most: **realistic surf zone simulation**. Watch waves:

- Build energy as they approach the shore
- Transform through the surf zone
- Form realistic breaking patterns with barrel formation
- Generate dynamic foam and spray
- Produce natural swash and backwash motion

All driven by **SDF (Signed Distance Field)** data from your shoreline, with full artistic control over every phase of the wave lifecycle.

### 3. Wave Forge Integration

Our companion tool **Wave Forge Studio** now integrates directly with Oceanology Pro 2.0:

- **21 Hermite spline profiles** defining complete wave lifecycles
- **Procedural generation** or **baked texture** workflows
- Export directly to HLSL shaders
- Real-time preview in Unreal Engine

## 📊 Technical Improvements

Beyond the major features, 2.0 brings significant architectural improvements:

| Feature | Oceanology Pro 1.2.5 | Oceanology Pro 2.0 |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Wave System | Gerstner | Spectral + Gerstner + Breaking |
| GPU Data | 4 DataBlocks | 15 DataBlocks |
| Coastal Simulation | ❌ None | ✅ Full SDF-based |
| Beaufort Integration | ❌ None | ✅ 0-12 Scale |
| Wave Components | 4 manual | Up to 128 spectral |
| Foam Generation | Basic | Physics-based |
| Normal Calculation | Approximated | Analytical derivatives |

## 🔧 Wave System Selector

New in 2.0: easily switch between wave systems per water body:

```cpp
enum class EOceanologyWaveSystemSelector : uint8
{
    None,                    // Flat water
    SpectralGerstnerWaves,   // New physically-based system
    GerstnerWaves            // Classic manual control
};
```

Mix and match systems across your project - use Spectral for open ocean, Legacy for stylized areas, and Breaking Waves for all coastlines.

## 🎮 Performance

Despite the massive feature additions, we've maintained excellent performance:

- **GPU-driven tessellation** remains highly efficient
- **LOD morphing** ensures smooth transitions
- Breaking waves only compute near shorelines
- Spectral synthesis uses optimized HLSL intrinsics

**Recommended specs remain unchanged** - if you could run 1.2.5, you can run 2.0.

## 📅 Release Timeline

- **Alpha Testing**: Q1 2026 (Selected developers)
- **Beta Release**: Q2 2026 (All existing customers)
- **Full Release**: Q3 2026 (FAB Store)

Existing Oceanology Pro (NextGen) customers will receive 2.0 as a **free update**.
